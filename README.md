curiousape.app is a website/app to introduce people to interesting stories about fascinating subjects in a fun, visual and interactive way. 

They can create an account and track their progress through the ever expanding library of subjects. 

The concept is aimed at getting people to be interested in things that they might not casually encounter in their daily lives. 
It was inspired by a video I saw where people on the streets of California were unable to name a single continent or planet, but were able to name all the the Kardashians. I want to help people become well-rounded in their knowledge so they can have more interesting conversations.
