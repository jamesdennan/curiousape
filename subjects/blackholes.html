<p>Black holes are fascinating cosmic phenomena that capture the imagination of scientists and the public alike. Here
    are some interesting facts about black holes:

    Formation: Black holes form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo gravitational collapse. The
    core contracts, and if the mass is above a certain threshold, the gravitational forces become so intense that
    nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull.

    Event Horizon: The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon. Once an object crosses this
    boundary, it is irreversibly pulled into the black hole. Beyond the event horizon, escape is impossible due to the
    immense gravitational forces.

    Sizes and Types: Black holes come in different sizes. Stellar black holes, formed from collapsing stars, typically
    have masses up to 20 times that of the Sun. Intermediate black holes have masses between 100 and 100,000 times that
    of the Sun. Supermassive black holes, found at the centers of most galaxies, can have millions or even billions of
    times the Sun's mass.

    Time Dilation: According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, time near a black hole flows more slowly
    compared to distant observers. This phenomenon, known as time dilation, means that time passes differently in the
    strong gravitational field near a black hole.

    Hawking Radiation: In 1974, physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes are not completely black but can
    emit tiny amounts of thermal radiation. This process, now known as Hawking radiation, suggests that black holes can
    slowly lose mass and eventually evaporate over extremely long periods.

    Spaghettification: The gravitational forces near a black hole are so strong that they can stretch and distort
    objects that come too close. This stretching effect is known as "spaghettification." As an object gets closer to a
    black hole, the tidal forces become stronger, causing it to be stretched into a long, thin shape.

    No Escape Velocity: The escape velocity from a black hole is greater than the speed of light, making it impossible
    for anything, including light itself, to escape once inside the event horizon. This challenges our traditional
    understanding of escape velocities and the nature of space and time.

    Supermassive Black Holes at Galactic Centers: Many galaxies, including our own Milky Way, harbor supermassive black
    holes at their centers. These enormous black holes play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.

    Gravitational Waves: In 2015, scientists made a groundbreaking discovery by detecting gravitational waves – ripples
    in spacetime – caused by the collision of two black holes. This observation confirmed a prediction made by Albert
    Einstein a century earlier in his theory of general relativity.

    Unknown Interior: The interior of a black hole is still a mystery. The singularity at the center, where mass is
    concentrated to an infinitely small point, challenges our understanding of the laws of physics. The extreme
    conditions within a black hole make it difficult for current theories to describe what happens beyond the event
    horizon.</p>
